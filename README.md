Tasks:
1. Task1: PSNR (5‚Äô):
Write a function to measure the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) between two gray images in dB. For the peak value use 255. 255^2

2. Task 2 (37‚Äô)
In this task, we use the monochrome image Lenna (i.e., lenna512.bmp ) to do the following
sub tasks, and let‚Äôs call the original image Lenna as I0.
(a) I0 -> down-sampling to I1 with 1/2 size of I0 (both horizontally and vertically) using mean value. First, describe your algorithm and implement it by yourself. Then, display it and compare to the original image. Finally, explain your founding in the report; (10‚Äô)
(b) I1-> up-sampling to I1‚Äô with the same size of I0 using nearest neighbor interpolation. First, describe your algorithm and implement it by yourself. Then, display it and compare to the original image. Finally, explain your founding in the report. (12‚Äô)
(c) First,calculatethePSNRbetweentheoriginalimageI0andtheup-sampledimages,i.e., nearest, bilinear, and bicubic, respectively. Then, describe the algorithm of bilinear. Finally, Compare the results of different interpolation methods and Explain your founding in the report. (15‚Äô) (Note: for the bilinear and bicubic interpolation, you can use the matlab function directly).

Task 3 (26‚Äô)
Import the image ‚Äúlenna512_low_dynamic_range.bmp‚Äù as im_ldr, then finish the following sub-tasks:
(1) Write a function to generate a piece-wise linear mapping transform to enhance the contrast of im_ldr; Verify the effectiveness of several mapping transform functions by
            3.

evaluating the PSNR with respect to the reference image, and show all enhanced images;
Identify the best intensity mapping function you obtained. (10‚Äô)
(2) Briefly describe the technique of histogram equalization; Use this technique to enhance

Task 4 (32‚Äô)
In this task, we use the monochrome image Lenna (i.e., lenna512.bmp ) to do the following sub tasks, and let‚Äôs call this reference image Lenna as im.
a) Add Gaussian white noise with zero mean and variance 16 to the image im and display the noisy image. Name it as im_wn. Please write one function to generate this image instead of calling matlab function directly. (6‚Äô)
b) Describe the technique of average filter and weighted average filter with a 3X3 window, respectively. Then implement both of them by yourself and use the same template in the slides. Finally, compute the PSNR in the following table and display all filtered images and compare them to the original image. You can use add one boundary with the same as its neighboring pixel values (i.e., nearest neighbor padding). (10‚Äô)
Method Average filter Weighted average filter PSNR (dB)
c) Describe the technique of Image Averaging, and explain why it can remove noise. Use this technique to remove the noise of im_wn, e.g., average 10 images to get im_wn10, average 100 images to get im_wn100, and average 1000 images to get im_wn1000. You need to implement this by yourself.
Display these three images and Evaluate the PSNR of these three images with respect to the reference image im.
Comment which one is better by comparing to the mean. (16‚Äô)
